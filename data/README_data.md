# Data
This folder contains 2 data sets. The first dataset contains **sample data**, and the second contains **subsets used for Python Instructional Modules.**

The original dataset contains County Public Health data from all 50 states, on a wide variety of public health implication variables. This dataset can be manipulated in multiple different ways, some of which are illustrated in the subset notebook.
