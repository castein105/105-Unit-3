# Data
This folder contains 2 data sets and 2 visualizations. The first dataset contains **sample data**, and the second contains **subsets used for Python Instructional Modules.**

## Datasets
The original dataset contains County Public Health data from all 50 states, on a wide variety of public health implication variables. This dataset can be manipulated in multiple different ways, some of which are illustrated in the subset notebook. 

The subset contains health care proffesional data in North Carolina and New Jeresey.

## Visualizations
The first visualization is a bar graph illustrating the total number of primary care providers, mental health providers, and dentists in New Jersey and Noth Carolina.

The second visualization is a symbol map illustrating the total number of mental health proffesionals in New Jersey and North Carolina.

Both visualizations were created using the data from the "NC_NJ_subset."
