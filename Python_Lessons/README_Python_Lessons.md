# Python Lessons
This folder contains a python notebook written in Jupyter Lab for instructions.

The notebook includes instructions on how to manipulate the orignial dataset. Multiple different lines of code are used, ultimately leading to the creation of a new dataset and new csv. file. The new csv file that is created is a subset of the orginal dataset **CountyHealthData_2014-2015.** The new subset is called **NC_NJ_subset.**
