# County Health Data

## Purpose

This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's section of ENGL 105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This repository is the final project for **Unit 3: writing in the natural sciences.**

This repository contains 3 python notebooks, covering basic tops in Python3, and beggining modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis.

These materials have been adapted from the [Research Hub at UNC's Davis Library.](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/Python/)

## Description 

The original set contains data regarding county health data for all 50 states in America. The data included was colled in 2014 and 2015. 
The new dataset contains data from North Carolina and New Jeresy. The series included are the healthcare proffesionals: **primary care physicians, dentists, mental health providers.**

## Potential 

This repository was created to compare the access to health care proffesionals between New Jersey- my home state, and North Carolina- the state that I currently reside in.
