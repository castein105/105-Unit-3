# County Health Data

## Purpose

This is a repository contains datasets about public health in different counties in the United States of America. This repository is the final project for **Unit 3: writing in the natural sciences.**

This repository contains 1 python notebook, covering how to utilize the orginal county healthdata set, and visualizations created from the resulting subset. 


## Description 

The original set contains data regarding county health data for all 50 states in America. The data included was colled in 2014 and 2015. 
The new dataset contains data from North Carolina and New Jeresy. The series included are the healthcare proffesionals: **primary care physicians, dentists, mental health providers.**
